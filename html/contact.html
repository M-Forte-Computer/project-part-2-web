                    <h3>What causes inflation?</h3>
                    <p>Inflation can be caused by various factors, including increased demand for goods and services
                        (demand-pull inflation), rising production costs (cost-push inflation), or changes in monetary
                        policy such as an increase in the money supply.</p>

                    <h3>How does inflation affect the economy?</h3>
                    <p>Inflation affects the purchasing power of money, making goods and services more expensive. It can
                        lead to higher cost of living and impact savings, investments, and wages. In high inflation
                        environments, businesses may struggle with price stability and forecasting costs.</p>

                    <h3>Can inflation be controlled?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, inflation can be controlled through monetary policies such as raising interest rates or
                        reducing the money supply. Governments can also implement fiscal policies, such as reducing
                        public spending or raising taxes, to manage inflationary pressures.</p>

                    <h3>How does inflation affect my savings?</h3>
                    <p>If inflation exceeds the interest rates on savings accounts, the real value of your savings
                        declines over time, meaning your money loses purchasing power. This discourages saving and may
                        encourage individuals to seek riskier investments to preserve wealth.</p>

                    <h3>What is hyperinflation?</h3>
                    <p>Hyperinflation is an extremely high and typically accelerating rate of inflation, often exceeding
                        50% per month. It leads to a rapid decrease in the value of a currency and creates a vicious
                        cycle of price increases. Hyperinflation usually occurs when there is a large increase in the
                        money supply, often due to irresponsible government policies or a collapse in confidence in a
                        currency.</p>

                    <h3>How does inflation impact interest rates?</h3>
                    <p>Inflation and interest rates are closely related. Central banks raise interest rates to control
                        high inflation by making borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive. Higher interest
                        rates help reduce spending and borrowing, which in turn can lower inflation. Conversely, when
                        inflation is low, central banks may lower interest rates to stimulate spending and investment.

                    <h3>What is the difference between inflation and deflation?</h3>
                    <p>Inflation refers to the rise in prices of goods and services over time, resulting in a decrease
                        in the purchasing power of money. Deflation, on the other hand, is the decline in prices, which
                        increases the purchasing power of money. While inflation can cause economic instability and
                        erode savings, deflation can lead to reduced consumer spending, economic stagnation, and higher
                        unemployment.</p>

                    <h3>Can inflation be good for the economy?</h3>
                    <p>Moderate inflation can be beneficial for the economy as it encourages spending and investing. If
                        inflation is too low, consumers may delay purchases, expecting prices to fall, which can reduce
                        economic activity. A healthy level of inflation can also help reduce the real burden of debt and
                        allow wages to grow, helping businesses thrive.</p>

                    <h3>How do wages relate to inflation?</h3>
                    <p>Wages and inflation are often linked in what is called the "wage-price spiral." When inflation
                        rises, workers demand higher wages to keep up with the increased cost of living. If businesses
                        meet these demands, they may raise prices to cover the increased labor costs, which can
                        contribute to further inflation. This cycle can continue if inflation expectations remain high.

                    <h3>What is core inflation?</h3>
                    <p>Core inflation refers to the measure of inflation that excludes volatile items such as food and
                        energy prices. It provides a more stable view of the long-term trend in inflation, helping
                        policymakers make decisions about monetary policy. Core inflation is often used as an indicator
                        to assess the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.</p>

                    <h3>What is demand-pull inflation?</h3>
                    <p>Demand-pull inflation occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds the economyâ€™s
                        productive capacity. This leads to price increases as consumers compete to purchase limited
                        goods. Factors such as increased consumer spending, government expenditure, or rising investment
                        can contribute to demand-pull inflation.</p>

                    <h3>What is cost-push inflation?</h3>
                    <p>Cost-push inflation occurs when the cost of production rises, leading to an increase in the
                        prices of goods and services. This can happen due to higher raw material costs, wages, or energy
                        prices. Businesses typically pass these higher costs on to consumers in the form of higher
                        prices.</p>
